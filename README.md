# Healthy Programmer

* We programmers work so hard all day and most of us sit on their chairÂ for more than 8 hours a day.

* This causes eyes weakness and we don't drink much water as we don't leave the chair often which causes back pain that leads to health issues.

* To solve this problem, Here is a program that alerts us to drink water, do eye exercise, and do physical exercise by playing music at intervals.

* This program also saves your logs in a text file.

## Requirement

Install Pygame module

```bash
  pip install pygame
```
